# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This project allowed me to build an Employee-Tracker node.js application that uses mySQL and Inquirer. Using a command line input, the user will be able to add departments, roles, employees and update employee roles. This project allowed me to gain an understanding using mySQL on not only how to establish a mySQL connection but also how to create and join tables using user input.

## Installation

npm install mysql2
